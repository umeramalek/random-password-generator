# Random Password Generator

This is a random Password generator. On the page, when you click on the generate password, a window alert pops up asking your desired length of password, once chosen it will ask for your desired characters. and then it will generate the password. 

## Getting Started

For starters I created a repository on github for code refactor, and git cloned it to my computer. added the hw materials to the file and pushed it to the git hub using git add . , git commit -m and git push origin main. 

(Note: I only have one-two commit messages because I didnt realize until later, that I was given a code to start with, and so I created a whole new code from bottom up and got myself stuck in thatðŸ˜­, until very close to the due date. Here is my repo for the one I made from scratch, I never completed it becuase I got stuck but I still made it from scratch. https://github.com/umeramalek/password-generator)

### Prerequisites

So I created another repo on github and cloned it down and started from scratch on the js code, and then I only used 1-2 commits. 

### Javascript
1. created variables for characters
2. Password lenght alert to choose the lenght of the password
3. to make the password length between 8-128
4.  window prompts to ask if they want characters
5. conditions to set if they click cancel 
6. random character generator formula
